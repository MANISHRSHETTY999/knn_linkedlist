K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm with Linked List
This repository contains a simple implementation of the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using a linked list data structure in C.

Overview
The K Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a popular machine learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. Given a dataset with labeled data points, KNN predicts the label of a new data point by considering the labels of its K nearest neighbors in the feature space.

In this implementation:
Data points are represented as nodes in a linked list.
Euclidean distance is used as the distance metric to measure the proximity between data points.
The algorithm finds the K nearest neighbors to a given query point.
